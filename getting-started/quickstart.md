# The Blaze Way

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/welcome_email_header.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>By Traders, For Traders</p></figcaption></figure>

We built BlazeTrade to help retail traders cross the chasm from part-time to full-time traders. In 2017, we left our jobs to pursue trading full-time. At the time, we believed that we could combine a passion for markets into reliable profits and finally live life on our own terms. What we found was that the tools and knowledge we needed to become successful did not exist. Instead, knowledge, data, and tools were split across an ocean of legacy brokers and poorly supported software tools.

In the end, we built BlazeTrade for traders because we had to.

### Import

GitBook supports importing content from many popular writing tools and formats. If your content already exists, you can upload a file or group of files to be imported.

### Sync a repository

GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
