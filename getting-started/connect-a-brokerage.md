## FAQ

<details>

<summary>How does this work? Is BlazeTrade safe to use?</summary>

Yes, BlazeTrade brokerage integrations are well-used and battle tested. We personally use and depend on the BlazeTrade platform everyday for our own trading.

BlazeTrade will leverage existing APIs provided by your brokerage to connect your existing trading account. While our implementation may differ from partner to partner, we prioritize using secure approaches utilizing technology like OAuth and SSL encryption.
