# Welcome

### BlazeTrade is a trading platform for retail traders who want to turn passion into profits â€” from trade generation, to position tracking and automated risk management.

## The Blaze Way

We built BlazeTrade to help retail traders cross the chasm from part-time to full-time traders. In 2017, we left our jobs to pursue trading full-time. At the time, we believed that we could combine a passion for markets into reliable profits. What a dream! We could finally live life on our own terms.&#x20;

However, what we found was that the tools and knowledge we needed to become successful did not exist. Instead, knowledge, data, and tools were split across an ocean of legacy brokers and poorly supported software tools.&#x20;

In the end, we built BlazeTrade because we had to - and now we're releasing the tools we built to you.
