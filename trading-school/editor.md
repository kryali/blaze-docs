# Option Basics

Warren Buffet has sometimes refered to derivatives like options as _"_financial weapons of mass destruction_" ._ Any trader who has been curious about the market has no doubt come across options in some form or another. Either as a cautionary tale or as a vehicle for financial freedom.&#x20;

Options are a unique tool for expressing an opinion on markets. While most traders are familiar with stock, they often only ever profit when markets go up - this is the long side.
