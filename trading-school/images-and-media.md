# Market Primer

The market is a phenomenon that is often overcomplicated by endless analysis and theory. We take a practical view: markets are tools for generating income. We care less about why prices move, only that they do move. Our work then is figuring out how to best capitalize on these market movements.

We think of markets like weather patterns, storms, and ocean currents. A skilled sailor doesn't need to fully grasp atmospheric physics to navigate safely, but they must master reading conditions, understanding patterns, and making decisive moves at the right moment. Trading demands similar practical expertise: a clear strategy, consistent execution, and disciplined risk management.

### Trading is Not Investing

Oceans of ink have been spilled over the theories of investing, so we dare not spill more here. Our view is that trading and investing are fundamentally different approaches to the market. While investing may rely on fundamentals and market research, trading relies on market conditions, tradable opportunities, and execution.&#x20;
