# Market Primer

The market is a phenomenon that is often overcomplicated by endless analysis and theory. We take a practical view: markets are tools for generating income. We care less about why prices move, only that they do move. Our work then is figuring out how to best capitalize on these market movements.

We think of markets like weather patterns, storms, and ocean currents. A skilled sailor doesn't need to fully grasp atmospheric physics to navigate safely, but they must master reading conditions, understanding patterns, and making decisive moves at the right moment. Trading demands similar practical expertise:

1. Clear strategy
2. Disciplined execution
3. Risk management
